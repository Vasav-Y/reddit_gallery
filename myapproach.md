# **KOSS TASK**

## Create reddit_gallery
## The task was to build a frontend only app to view images from the subreddit -> r/pics

* It is maintained by **Facebook** and a community of individual developers and companies.

### npm:
* It is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language
* npm is the world's largest Software Registry.
* Open-source developers use npm to share software.
* Many organizations also use npm to manage private development.

### npx:

* And while doing that I had to read
