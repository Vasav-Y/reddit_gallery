### Create reddit_gallery
#### The task was to build a frontend only app to view images from the subreddit -> r/pics

* So first thing which comes in our mind is : What is **subreddit**?

* Before understanding subreddit we should know about **Reddit**

* Reddit is a network of communities based on people's interests, there is a community for almost everyone, find the community in which you're interested and become part of it

* And a **subreddit** is a forum dedicated to a specific topic on **Reddit**

* As I have never before created an app and in the task information it was given that javascript or a similar language that can run in browser universally can be used so I went on google and searched how to create apps using js

* While searching I came across the React library of Javascript *React* is an open-source front-end JavaScript library for building **user interfaces or UI** components. It is maintained by **Facebook** and a community of individual developers and companies.
